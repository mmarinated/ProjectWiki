- Data: https://www.kaggle.com/c/web-traffic-time-series-forecasting. 
- Results: can be found in [Report](Report_ZavalinaM.pdf).

First, run `preprocessing/cleaning_data_files.ipynb` to create the data, `preprocessing/separate_data.ipynb` to obtain indices for weekly seasonal pages, pages with many zeros.   
To achieve best results, run `models/simple_models.ipynb` (fast), `models/kalman_filter.ipynb`, `models/model_rnn.ipynb`.
